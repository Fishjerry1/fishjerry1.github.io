	<p>On January 18, 2024, I was directly involved in the successful rollout of the National Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) Management Information System (NOMIS) 3.0 in Kano State, a critical component of the USAID-funded Integrated Child Health and Social Services Award (ICHSSA 3) Project. This initiative was a significant step in enhancing Nigeria's national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by fundamentally improving data management for OVC programs across the state.</p>
	<p>My responsibilities included overseeing aspects of the system's deployment and ensuring its readiness for field use. NOMIS 3.0, adopted by the Government of Nigeria as the national OVC database, is a robust web application designed to operate seamlessly in both offline and online modes, which is crucial for data collection in diverse and often remote field settings. I focused on verifying that its modular design and stringent data validation rules were effectively minimizing entry errors and upholding data quality, which is paramount for generating reliable reports and informing interventions.</p>
	<p>The system's capability to generate essential reports, including donor-specific requirements and custom service statistics, was a key area I monitored, as it provides timely insights into client lists and OVC status updates. Furthermore, I ensured that the flexible data transmission features—through export, import, and synchronization with a central server—were functioning optimally, making field data readily accessible for analysis and project management.</p>
	<p>This deployment, which I helped to facilitate, is a testament to our commitment to leveraging electronic records for improved program outcomes and data-driven decision-making in the fight against HIV/AIDS and its impact on vulnerable children.</p>

	<p>From September 10 to 16, 2024, I played a key role in a crucial capacity-building initiative in Bauchi, where I contributed to the comprehensive training of State AIDS Control Agency (SACA) Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Officers. This training was an integral component of the USAID-funded Integrated Child Health and Social Services Award (ICHSSA 3) Project, which is dedicated to reducing the impact of HIV/AIDS on orphans and vulnerable children in Nigeria.</p>
	<p>My involvement focused on delivering practical sessions and guiding officers through the intricacies of M&E. I addressed the critical need for enhanced M&E capacity at the sub-national level, recognizing that while M&E systems are designed to generate data for evidence-based decision-making, data utilization can often be limited among stakeholders, particularly at state and local government levels. The curriculum I helped to deliver covered fundamental M&E principles and practices, equipping officers with the essential skills to effectively track program activities, outputs, and outcomes.</p>
	<p>Key areas included developing robust M&E strategies and frameworks, understanding indicator measures, and utilizing appropriate tools for data collection and analysis. By strengthening the M&E capabilities of SACA officers in Bauchi, I directly contributed to the ICHSSA 3 project's overarching goal of ensuring quality service provision and improving the socioeconomic conditions of OVC and their households.</p>
	<p>This investment in local human resources is vital for institutionalizing a national data flow system, enabling seamless data transmission from communities and health facilities up to federal levels, and ultimately fostering a more coordinated and effective HIV/AIDS response in Nigeria.</p>

<p>In September 2024, I provided comprehensive technical support to Yobe State as part of the Integrated Child Health and Social Services Award (ICHSSA 3) Project. This targeted intervention was designed to bolster the state's capacity in delivering high-quality, integrated health and social services to orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) affected by HIV/AIDS.</p>  
<p>My technical support encompassed a range of critical areas, tailored to the specific needs identified within Yobe State's health and social welfare systems. This included strengthening local health information systems, enhancing data management practices, and improving the overall quality of service delivery for OVCs. Given the project's focus on HIV/AIDS, my work was instrumental in optimizing patient management and monitoring, leveraging electronic medical record systems like NOMIS (National OVCs Management Information System) for efficient data capture and analysis related to HIV care and treatment. </p>  
<p>Furthermore, the technical assistance I provided aimed to reinforce the capacity of CSO and CCMWs to provide sustainable services, aligning with the broader goal of advancing self-reliance in health outcomes.  Through my direct engagement, I ensured that Yobe State was equipped with the necessary tools, knowledge, and systems to effectively implement the ICHSSA 3 project's interventions, ultimately contributing to improved well-being and resilience for vulnerable children and their households.</p>

<p>Shelleng LGA, Adamawa State—where adventure meets pure, unfiltered joy! I’ll never forget the day we arrived in this vibrant little village during the National OVC Pilot Survey. As usual, the kids were the first to greet us—eyes wide with curiosity and excitement, like they knew something special was about to happen. Little did they know, I had a few tricks up my sleeve to make their day unforgettable!</p>  
<p>Amid the hustle of survey activities, I found myself drawn to the kids' boundless energy and contagious laughter. My heart ached when I saw that their only source of drinking water was a murky river—used for everything from cooking to washing. It hit me hard, and I couldn’t help but wonder how I could make their lives just a little bit brighter in that moment.</p>  
<p>So, I did what I do best—I joined them! We kicked off an epic game of football right there on the dusty field, and trust me, these kids have serious skills. We laughed, cheered, and made up wild team names, and I have to admit, they almost ran circles around me. Then came my secret weapon—a game I invented on the spot that had them shrieking with delight. It was pure magic to see their faces light up, even just for a little while.</p>  
<p>I also made it a point to visit some families and share a few stories, just listening to their experiences and learning more about their lives. There was something so genuine about the way they welcomed me, even with all the challenges they face daily. The love and resilience in that community are truly inspiring, and it reminded me of why I do what I do.</p>  
<p>I left Shelleng with a heart full of gratitude and a promise to myself to return someday—hopefully with better solutions and improved support for those amazing kids. They may not know it, but they left a lasting mark on me, and I’ll carry their smiles and stories with me wherever I go.</p>

<p>My data collection field experience took me on an adventurous journey from Yola in Adamawa State to Garkida village in Gombi LGA, Adamawa State. It was a daunting five-hour journey each way, and despite the challenges, I made the trip to and fro every day, working for barely four hours due to the security situation in the area. The reality of traveling through a red zone, known for security concerns and surrounded by the infamous Sambisa forest, did little to deter my determination.</p>  
<p>Garkida is a resilient village, separated from Borno State by a winding river, and it has faced its fair share of hardships due to bandit activities. Yet, I knew that embarking on this one-week trip was essential to understanding the struggles of the women and children living there. My goal was to assess how we could better support and improve their livelihoods, no matter the risks involved.</p>  
<p>Despite the gravity of the situation, my time with the children was truly heartwarming. Their energy and enthusiasm were infectious, and I couldn’t resist sharing some of the simple games I grew up playing as a kid. Teaching them new games and watching them light up with joy made every challenge along the way worthwhile. The bond we created during those moments was priceless.</p>  
<p>Looking back, I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. I believe that children deserve every ounce of effort it takes to bring them joy and hope, no matter how far or how risky the journey may be. Garkida and its resilient spirit will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>

<p>Our journey to Garkida wasn’t just about the miles—it was about the mission. Traveling 5 hours from Yola to Garkida and back each day was no small feat, but the determination to connect with the community kept us going. The first step on arrival was a courtesy visit to the Chief of the land, where we shared our plans and agenda for the data collection exercise. The Chief's warm reception set the tone for the work ahead.</p>  
<p>However, Garkida, being a predominantly Muslim community, posed a unique cultural challenge. The practice of **“Ba shiga”**—a Hausa term meaning *“no entry”*—restricts men from entering households where women are present without explicit permission. To respect this cultural norm while still achieving our mission, we had to gather all the male heads of households in a central location for an open conversation. It was the perfect opportunity to put my advocacy and stakeholder engagement skills to the test, and I couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride as I navigated the conversation with a touch of Hausa, thanks to the invaluable support of an interpreter. Seeing their faces light up with smiles as we connected was truly rewarding, reminding me that genuine effort and respect for their culture go a long way. </p>  
<p>I approached the meeting with humor and warmth, easing any tension and bringing smiles to the faces of everyone present. My lighthearted approach created an atmosphere of openness and trust, allowing us to communicate effectively and lay the groundwork for the data collection process. It was a remarkable experience that highlighted the importance of cultural sensitivity and community collaboration. Despite the long journeys and the challenges, it was worth every effort, knowing that we were making a difference, one community at a time.</p>

<p>The National Training on Data Quality Assessment for Federal and State Ministry of Women Affairs Staff from 16 USAID-supported states in Nigeria was a remarkable milestone in our journey towards strengthening the quality and accuracy of OVC data. As part of the transition from the ICHSSA award (2019–2024) to the new THRIVE award, it was crucial to ensure that all OVC data remained reliable and consistent. To achieve this, we designed a comprehensive training program aimed at equipping ministry staff with the necessary skills to conduct data quality assessments as they prepared to oversee the transitioning exercise.</p>  
<p>I had the privilege of spearheading the development of the OVC Data Quality Assessment (DQA) Protocol ahead of the transitioning phase. This protocol was specifically crafted to guide the USAID Implementing Partners as they moved from the ICHSSA award to the THRIVE award, ensuring that data quality standards were upheld throughout the process. It was an immense responsibility, but with the collaborative effort of my dedicated team members, we were able to produce a robust and practical framework.</p>  
<p>The training brought together representatives from both the Federal and State Ministry of Women Affairs across 16 USAID-supported states. It was designed to enhance their capacity to supervise and monitor the OVC DQA Transitioning exercise. During the sessions, we covered essential concepts, practical strategies, and hands-on exercises to build their proficiency in data quality assessment. We also emphasized the importance of consistent data verification, validation, and reporting to maintain data integrity during the transition.</p>  
<p>It was truly fulfilling to see how the participants embraced the training with enthusiasm and dedication. We fostered an interactive learning environment, encouraging questions, discussions, and experience sharing among the participants. The atmosphere was charged with a strong sense of commitment to the cause, and it was clear that everyone was fully invested in ensuring the continuity of high-quality data for OVC program implementation.</p>  
<p>Leading the training alongside my team members was a humbling and rewarding experience. It reinforced the significance of data quality in program management and highlighted the pivotal role that well-trained personnel play in sustaining accurate reporting practices. Together, we left the training confident that the Federal and State Ministry of Women Affairs staff were well-equipped to carry out their supervisory and monitoring duties during the OVC DQA transitioning exercise.</p>

<p>Leading the OVC Data Quality Assessment (DQA) Transitioning Exercise in Akwa Ibom State was an incredible experience! Alongside three dedicated team members, I had the privilege of guiding 65 passionate data enumerators—comprising about 40% women and 60% men—hailing from diverse cultural backgrounds but united by a common goal: ensuring data quality and accuracy. </p>
<p>The exercise was comprehensive and demanding, involving the folder audit of all active OVC clients within the reporting period. We thoroughly assessed the Management Information System (MIS) NOMIS, generating and reviewing reports to match the records with what was reported in the master sheet submitted. Additionally, the exercise included household visits to HIV-positive clients whose documented phone numbers were unreachable, as well as phone calls to 5% of HIV-positive OVC clients to verify if they were truly receiving OVC support services from the implementing partners. For those whose phone numbers remained unreachable, a 3% sample was visited, provided they had a clearly documented address in their folders.</p>
<p>Collaboration was key to our success, and we worked closely with community case workers managing the clients, as well as the Implementing Partners' M&E staff and the Community-Based Organization (CBO) M&E staff responsible for retrieving the folders for the audit. To streamline the process, I developed a dynamic real-time Power BI dashboard, integrated via API with the Kobo Toolbox, enabling us to track the enumerators' data assessment progress daily. </p>
<p>The entire exercise spanned three weeks and was a remarkable success, thanks to the dedication and commitment of everyone involved. It was truly rewarding to witness the synergy and hard work put into ensuring accurate and reliable data—an accomplishment that left us all proud and motivated to keep making an impact!</p>

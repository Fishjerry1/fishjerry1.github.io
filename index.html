<p>The DQA for GHPHI CSO in Kano led to the identification of 12 critical data quality issues, which, upon rectification, improved their data completeness by 20% and data accuracy by 15%. This assessment directly contributed to GHPHI's ability to provide more accurate reports, strengthening their accountability and eligibility for future funding.</p>  
<p>My hands-on strategies included:</p>
<p>Comprehensive Data Traceability Audit: I conducted a thorough audit of GHPHI's data flow, tracing data from source documents through various aggregation points to final reports, identifying bottlenecks and potential error sources.</p>  
<p>Direct Engagement with Data Entry Personnel: I engaged directly with data entry personnel, observing their processes, providing immediate feedback on best practices, and addressing any challenges they faced in real-time.</p>
<p>Developing Corrective Action Plans: Based on the DQA findings, I collaborated with GHPHI staff to develop and implement a practical corrective action plan, including specific steps and timelines for addressing identified data quality gaps.</p>

<p>The National Training on Data Quality Assessment for Federal and State Ministry of Women Affairs Staff from 16 USAID-supported states in Nigeria was a remarkable milestone in our journey towards strengthening the quality and accuracy of OVC data. As part of the transition from the ICHSSA award (2019–2024) to the new THRIVE award, it was crucial to ensure that all OVC data remained reliable and consistent. To achieve this, we designed a comprehensive training program aimed at equipping ministry staff with the necessary skills to conduct data quality assessments as they prepared to oversee the transitioning exercise.</p>  
<p>I had the privilege of spearheading the development of the OVC Data Quality Assessment (DQA) Protocol ahead of the transitioning phase. This protocol was specifically crafted to guide the USAID Implementing Partners as they moved from the ICHSSA award to the THRIVE award, ensuring that data quality standards were upheld throughout the process. It was an immense responsibility, but with the collaborative effort of my dedicated team members, we were able to produce a robust and practical framework.</p>  
<p>The training brought together representatives from both the Federal and State Ministry of Women Affairs across 16 USAID-supported states. It was designed to enhance their capacity to supervise and monitor the OVC DQA Transitioning exercise. During the sessions, we covered essential concepts, practical strategies, and hands-on exercises to build their proficiency in data quality assessment. We also emphasized the importance of consistent data verification, validation, and reporting to maintain data integrity during the transition.</p>  
<p>It was truly fulfilling to see how the participants embraced the training with enthusiasm and dedication. We fostered an interactive learning environment, encouraging questions, discussions, and experience sharing among the participants. The atmosphere was charged with a strong sense of commitment to the cause, and it was clear that everyone was fully invested in ensuring the continuity of high-quality data for OVC program implementation.</p>  
<p>Leading the training alongside my team members was a humbling and rewarding experience. It reinforced the significance of data quality in program management and highlighted the pivotal role that well-trained personnel play in sustaining accurate reporting practices. Together, we left the training confident that the Federal and State Ministry of Women Affairs staff were well-equipped to carry out their supervisory and monitoring duties during the OVC DQA transitioning exercise.</p>

<p>Leading the OVC Data Quality Assessment (DQA) Transitioning Exercise in Akwa Ibom State was an incredible experience! Alongside three dedicated team members, I had the privilege of guiding 65 passionate data enumerators—comprising about 40% women and 60% men—hailing from diverse cultural backgrounds but united by a common goal: ensuring data quality and accuracy. </p>
<p>The exercise was comprehensive and demanding, involving the folder audit of all active OVC clients within the reporting period. We thoroughly assessed the Management Information System (MIS) NOMIS, generating and reviewing reports to match the records with what was reported in the master sheet submitted. Additionally, the exercise included household visits to HIV-positive clients whose documented phone numbers were unreachable, as well as phone calls to 5% of HIV-positive OVC clients to verify if they were truly receiving OVC support services from the implementing partners. For those whose phone numbers remained unreachable, a 3% sample was visited, provided they had a clearly documented address in their folders.</p>
<p>Collaboration was key to our success, and we worked closely with community case workers managing the clients, as well as the Implementing Partners' M&E staff and the Community-Based Organization (CBO) M&E staff responsible for retrieving the folders for the audit. To streamline the process, I developed a dynamic real-time Power BI dashboard, integrated via API with the Kobo Toolbox, enabling us to track the enumerators' data assessment progress daily. </p>
<p>The entire exercise spanned three weeks and was a remarkable success, thanks to the dedication and commitment of everyone involved. It was truly rewarding to witness the synergy and hard work put into ensuring accurate and reliable data—an accomplishment that left us all proud and motivated to keep making an impact!</p>
